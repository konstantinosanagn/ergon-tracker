"""Posting-level visa-sponsorship policy, from the job description text (deterministic regex).

Distinct from ``extract/visa.py`` (which says whether the *employer* has historically sponsored
H-1B via DoL data). This reads what the *posting itself* states about sponsorship:

* "visa sponsorship available", "we will sponsor", "sponsorship welcome"      -> True
* "must not require sponsorship now or in the future", "we do not sponsor",
  "must be authorized to work without sponsorship", "not eligible for sponsorship" -> False
* no mention                                                                  -> None (unknown)

Tri-state on purpose: most postings say nothing, so unknown is common and must stay unknown
(never guessed). Negative statements are checked first, because phrasings like "unable to offer
sponsorship" contain the positive substring "offer sponsorship" but clearly mean *no*.
