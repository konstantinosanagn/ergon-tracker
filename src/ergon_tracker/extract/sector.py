# High-precision company-NAME -> sector tokens. ONLY unambiguous industry words belong here:
# a company literally named "<X> Bank" / "<X> Hospitality" / "<X> Manufacturing" is in that
# industry. This is the opposite of description-text classification (dropped at ~24% accuracy):
# the company's own name naming its industry is a strong signal. Applied ONLY when the curated
# table misses, so it never overrides authoritative data; opaque brand names stay "unknown".
# Deliberately omits generic words ("industries", "technology", "group", "partners", "labs",
# "energy", "motors") that carry no reliable sector signal.
