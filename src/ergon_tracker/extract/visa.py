"""H-1B visa-sponsor signal — table-backed, from US DoL OFLC LCA disclosure data.

The Department of Labor publishes (free, official) quarterly disclosure files of every Labor
Condition Application — the petition an employer must file to hire an H-1B worker. An employer
appearing there with a *certified* LCA is a demonstrated visa sponsor. We distill that bulk data
offline (see ``scripts/build_h1b_sponsors.py``) into a compact set of normalized employer names
shipped as ``registry/data/h1b_sponsors.json``, and tag matching postings with ``visa_sponsor``.

Honesty note: this gives **positive** evidence only. A company *in* the set has sponsored H-1B
visas; a company *not* in it is ``unknown`` (the data is historical and name-matching is fuzzy),
never asserted as a non-sponsor. So we only ever set ``visa_sponsor = True``.

Matching is by normalized company name (``dedup.normalize_company``), since LCA employer names
("STRIPE, INC.") and posting company names ("Stripe") both collapse to the same key ("stripe").
