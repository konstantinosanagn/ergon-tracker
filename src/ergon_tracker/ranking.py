"""Relevance ranking for search results (deterministic, dependency-free).

After fetch + filter + dedup, results arrive in *source order* — which has nothing to do
with how well a posting matches the user's query. Without ranking, a search for ``"engineer"``
can surface an "Account Executive" role just because its *description* happens to mention
engineering. This module fixes precision while preserving recall: every candidate that passed
the filter is kept, but they are ordered by how well they actually match.

Design (deterministic-first, no ML, runs anywhere):

* **Field-weighted BM25 (BM25F-style).** Each field (title, department, company, description)
  is scored with its own Okapi BM25 — its own length normalization and IDF — and the per-field
  scores are combined as a weighted sum, with the title weighted far above the rest. Because a
  short title saturates fast and a long description normalizes against long descriptions, a
  title match dominates a description-only match, and keyword-stuffing the description can't
  masquerade as a title hit. BM25's k1/b give term-frequency saturation and length norm.
* **Stable.** Ties keep their prior order (authority/recency from dedup), so ranking only ever
  *improves* ordering, never scrambles equally-relevant results.

A pluggable :data:`Reranker` seam lets a stronger model (e.g. a cross-encoder such as ZeroEntropy
``zerank``) reorder the top-K later, installed as an optional extra — without touching the core.
By default no reranker is registered and ranking is pure lexical BM25.
