"""ergon_tracker MCP server — exposes the SDK as Model Context Protocol tools.

Run it (after ``pip install 'ergon-tracker[mcp]'``)::

    ergon-tracker-mcp            # stdio transport (for Claude Desktop / MCP clients)

Tools:
- ``search_jobs``     — unified search across ATS feeds + aggregators
- ``resolve_company`` — detect which ATS a company/URL uses + its board token
- ``list_sources``    — registered providers + registry size

The tools are thin adapters over the existing ``ergon_tracker`` API. ``search_jobs`` returns a
compact view of each posting (no raw payload / HTML) to keep tool responses small.

ergon-tracker: unified job search across company ATS feeds (49k+ boards) + aggregators.

Index vs. live — how to choose your `search_jobs` call:
- "roles at <company>" → pass `companies=[...]` (domains/careers URLs). This fetches LIVE from
  that company's ATS: fresh and exact. Use it whenever the user names a specific employer.
- "find me <X> jobs" (broad discovery, no specific company) → leave `companies` and `sources`
  empty. This serves from the prebuilt INDEX: fast, throttle-proof, complete coverage across
  every board we track.
- Every index-served response carries `as_of` (the `build-…` id) in its `health`, so freshness
  is always visible. The index is a daily snapshot and can lag a known company's live board by a
  day or two — if a user needs guaranteed up-to-the-second results for a named company, target it
  LIVE via `companies=[...]` even for an otherwise-broad query.
- Passing ATS provider names in `sources` (e.g. greenhouse, lever) forces a deliberate live crawl
  of those providers — slower; only do it when explicitly scoping to a provider.

    """Search jobs across company ATS feeds and aggregators, returning canonical postings.

    Args:
        keywords: free-text query. Matches on title/department/company/description, then
            results are ranked by relevance (field-weighted BM25; title matches rank highest)
            so the most relevant postings come first. Each job carries a `score`.
        semantic: if true, rank by meaning via embeddings instead of exact-token matching
            (handles synonyms / natural-language intent). Needs the server's `semantic` extra.
        location: substring match on posting location.
        remote: if true, keep only remote/hybrid roles.
        companies: company domains or careers URLs to target (e.g. ["stripe.com", "ramp.com"]).
            Best for "roles at <company>" questions — fast and precise.
        sources: restrict to provider names (e.g. greenhouse, lever, remoteok, adzuna). For a
            BROAD keyword search, leave both `companies` and `sources` empty: this tool then
            queries only the fast single-call aggregator/keyed APIs (RemoteOK, Remotive, Adzuna,
            USAJOBS, …) — quick and rate-limit-friendly. (A full 42k-company ATS crawl only
            happens if you explicitly pass ATS provider names in `sources`.)
        level: seniority filter — intern/entry/junior/mid/senior/staff/principal/lead/manager/
            director/executive (inferred from title; many titles have none -> "unknown").
        include_unknown_level: keep postings whose level couldn't be inferred (narrow without
            dropping unlabeled roles). Recommended when filtering by level on real data.
        sector: industry filter, e.g. "Fintech", "AI/ML", "Healthcare" (NAICS-informed).
        include_unknown_sector: keep postings with no detected sector.
        country / city: structured location filter. country accepts common aliases (USA/US ->
            United States, UK -> United Kingdom); city is metro-aware ("New York" also matches
            NYC boroughs / "New York City" / "NYC").
        salary_min / salary_max: compensation range (jobs without salary data are kept).
        salary_currency: restrict to a currency (e.g. "USD") when a salary bound is set, so a
            $140k floor doesn't return EUR/GBP postings.
        min_years / max_years: required years-of-experience range — ideal for "new grad / 0-2
            years" searches (min_years=0, max_years=2). Postings with no stated years are kept
            unless include_unknown_years=false.
        include_unknown_years: keep postings with no stated experience requirement (default true).
        employment_type: full_time / part_time / contract / internship / temporary / other.
            Postings that don't state a type are kept.
        posted_within_days: only postings published within the last N days (recency filter).
        max_age_days: freshness floor (default 365). ATS boards often leave FILLED reqs open for
            years, so a posting's presence isn't proof it's active — this hides postings whose most
            recent activity (posted/updated) is older than N days. Pass null to include stale ones.
        include_undated: keep postings with no date at all (default false; they correlate with stale).
        visa_sponsor: if true, keep only employers known to have sponsored H-1B visas (from US
            DoL LCA certified-filing data). Each job also reports a `visa_sponsor` flag.
        sponsorship_offered: filter on what the POSTING says about visa sponsorship. true =
            postings that offer it; false = postings that explicitly don't. Unknown postings
            (the majority) are kept by default. Each job reports `sponsorship_offered`
            (true/false/null). Tip for international applicants: pass false-exclusion by using
            true here to hide "no sponsorship" roles while keeping unstated ones.
        infer_level_from_experience: when a title has no seniority word, derive level from the
            required years of experience (boosts level coverage; combine with a `level` filter).
        semantic: rank by meaning via embeddings instead of exact-token matching (handles
            synonyms / natural-language intent). Needs the server's `semantic` extra.
        limit: max postings to return after dedup + ranking (default 20).

    Returns a dict with `count`, `jobs` (compact, relevance-ranked, each with a `score`),
    and per-source `health`.

    Examples (combine filters freely):
