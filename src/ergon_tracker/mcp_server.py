"""ergon_tracker MCP server — exposes the SDK as Model Context Protocol tools.

Run it (after ``pip install 'ergon-tracker[mcp]'``)::

    ergon-tracker-mcp            # stdio transport (for Claude Desktop / MCP clients)

Tools:
- ``search_jobs``     — unified search across ATS feeds + aggregators
- ``resolve_company`` — detect which ATS a company/URL uses + its board token
- ``list_sources``    — registered providers + registry size

The tools are thin adapters over the existing ``ergon_tracker`` API. ``search_jobs`` returns a
compact view of each posting (no raw payload / HTML) to keep tool responses small.

    Args:
        keywords: free-text query. Matches on title/department/company/description, then
            results are ranked by relevance (field-weighted BM25; title matches rank highest)
            so the most relevant postings come first. Each job carries a `score`.
        semantic: if true, rank by meaning via embeddings instead of exact-token matching
            (handles synonyms / natural-language intent). Needs the server's `semantic` extra.
        location: substring match on posting location.
        remote: if true, keep only remote/hybrid roles.
        companies: company domains or careers URLs to target (e.g. ["stripe.com", "ramp.com"]).
            Best for "roles at <company>" questions — fast and precise.
        sources: restrict to provider names (e.g. greenhouse, lever, remoteok, adzuna). For a
            BROAD keyword search, leave both `companies` and `sources` empty: this tool then
            queries only the fast single-call aggregator/keyed APIs (RemoteOK, Remotive, Adzuna,
            USAJOBS, …) — quick and rate-limit-friendly. (A full 42k-company ATS crawl only
            happens if you explicitly pass ATS provider names in `sources`.)
        level: seniority filter — intern/entry/junior/mid/senior/staff/principal/lead/manager/
            director/executive (inferred from title; many titles have none -> "unknown").
        include_unknown_level: keep postings whose level couldn't be inferred (narrow without
            dropping unlabeled roles). Recommended when filtering by level on real data.
        sector: industry filter, e.g. "Fintech", "AI/ML", "Healthcare" (NAICS-informed).
        include_unknown_sector: keep postings with no detected sector.
        country / city: structured location filter.
        salary_min / salary_max: compensation range (jobs without salary data are kept).
        visa_sponsor: if true, keep only employers known to have sponsored H-1B visas (from US
            DoL LCA certified-filing data). Each job also reports a `visa_sponsor` flag.
        limit: max postings to return after dedup + ranking (default 20).

    Returns a dict with `count`, `jobs` (compact, relevance-ranked, each with a `score`),
    and per-source `health`.
