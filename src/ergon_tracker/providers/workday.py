"""Workday provider — the hard one.

Workday is **per-tenant**, not a single global API. A board is identified by THREE parts:

1. ``tenant``      — the customer slug, e.g. ``nvidia`` / ``salesforce``
2. ``wd{N}``       — the data-center number, ``wd1`` .. ``wd12``, e.g. ``wd5``
3. ``site``        — the career-site path segment, e.g. ``NVIDIAExternalCareerSite``

Because a single string token must round-trip through the registry/resolver, we encode the
composite as a pipe-delimited token::

    "{tenant}|{wd}|{site}"          e.g.  "nvidia|wd5|NVIDIAExternalCareerSite"

``fetch`` parses the token back into its three parts. ``matches`` does the reverse: given a
careers URL or host it reconstructs the composite token (or returns ``None``).

Endpoints
---------
Jobs list (POST, no auth)::

    https://{tenant}.{wd}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}/jobs

with JSON body ``{"appliedFacets": {}, "limit": 20, "offset": 0, "searchText": ""}`` →
``{"total": <int>, "jobPostings": [{"title", "externalPath", "locationsText",
"postedOn", "bulletFields"}, ...]}``.

* ``limit`` maxes out at 20 per page; paginate by ``offset`` (0, 20, 40, ...).
* Pagination is bounded by ``MAX_PAGES`` (per-board ceiling) and by ``query.limit`` when set,
  so we never pull thousands of postings to satisfy a small search.
* ``query.keywords`` is passed straight into ``searchText`` for server-side search, which
  shrinks ``total`` at the source before we paginate.

Concurrency
-----------
The first page is fetched to learn ``total``; **all** remaining pages are then fetched
concurrently via ``anyio.create_task_group`` (one task per offset). We never page serially.
The ``AsyncFetcher`` already bounds global concurrency and per-host rate, so we simply launch
the tasks and collect each page into a dict keyed by its offset.
