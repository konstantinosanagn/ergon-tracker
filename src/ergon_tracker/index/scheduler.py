"""Adaptive crawl scheduler: decide which boards to crawl each build, and back off throttling.

Pure, offline-testable logic. The incremental builder persists one ``BoardState`` per board and
uses this module to (a) assign a freshness tier, (b) pick the boards due today, and (c) fold each
crawl outcome back into state (including throttle back-pressure). This is what shrinks a daily
build from "all 46k boards" to "only the ones likely to have changed" — the crawl-side
throttle-proofing.
