"""Job-aware cross-source deduplication & merge engine — the ergon_tracker differentiator.

Naive dedup (exact id or exact title match) misses the common real-world case: the *same*
role surfaced by an ATS (greenhouse/lever/...) and by an aggregator (remoteok) with a slightly
different title ("Sr. Backend Engineer" vs "Senior Backend Engineer"). This module collapses
those into one canonical posting while keeping the richest, most-authoritative record and
unioning provenance so callers can still see every source that yielded the job.

Pure / in-memory / no network. Efficiency comes from *blocking*: fuzzy comparison only ever
happens between records that share a normalized company, never O(n^2) over the whole list.
