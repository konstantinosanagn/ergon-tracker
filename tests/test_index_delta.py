"""Row-level deltas (v2.1): a returning user downloads only changed/deleted rows, not the whole file.

build_delta(prev, curr) emits a small file of upserts + deletes; apply_delta(base, delta) mutates a
copy of the cached prev index so it becomes query-equivalent to curr (same ids, content, companies,
FTS) — proven against build_index as the oracle.
