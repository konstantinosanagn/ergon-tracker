"""Unit tests for the Breezy HR provider (respx-mocked, offline).

Fixture ``breezy_jobs.json`` is a trimmed capture of the live
``https://10-4-truck-recruiting.breezy.hr/json`` response (token "10-4-truck-recruiting"),
augmented with a remote contractor and an intern position to exercise the field mapping.
