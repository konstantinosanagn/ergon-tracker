"""Re-verify candidate ATS boards by dogfooding ergon_tracker's own providers, then merge the
live ones into the seed registry.

This is both a verification gate and a concurrency stress test: every candidate is fetched
through the real provider stack, concurrently, bounded by the shared AsyncFetcher.

A board returns 0 jobs for very different reasons. A clean 200-with-no-postings or a 404 is a
*final* dead — the board really has nothing for us. But a 429 / timeout / open-circuit /
exhausted-retries is *transient*: the board may well be live, it just got throttled while a big
sweep hammered its ATS backend. Counting those as dead is how a throttle storm silently drops
real boards. So verification runs in two phases: a main pass, then a deliberately gentle
re-verify of only the transient failures, promoting any that come alive. Network knobs are
tunable so a recovery run can pace itself well under the ATS limits.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python scripts/build_registry.py [candidates.json] [--dry-run]
        [--concurrency N] [--per-host-rate N] [--timeout SECS] [--retries N]
        [--gentle] [--no-retry-transient] [--onboard-empty]

``--onboard-empty`` also registers confirmed-empty boards (HTTP 200, valid, 0 jobs) on trusted
JSON ATSes, so the daily build (which only crawls boards already in the registry) will pick up
their future postings. Off by default (strict >=1-job gate).
