"""Deterministic company -> sector map from Wikidata.

Strategy (free Wikidata SPARQL endpoint, batched POST queries):
  1. Domain match: companies with a website domain -> Wikidata P856 (official website).
  2. Label match: exact rdfs:label / skos:altLabel match on case-variants derived
     from the company key, requiring the entity to have P452 (industry).
For every matched entity we pull its P452 industry label(s) + sitelink count,
pick the most-notable entity (max sitelinks) per company, then map the industry
label to exactly one of our 27-label vocabulary.

Writes scripts/sector_wikidata.json. Does NOT touch seed.json / sectors.json.
